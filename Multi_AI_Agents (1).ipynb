Some people have symptoms and others do not. What Are The Symptoms? There are two types of diabetes: • Type 1 diabetes happens when the body stops making insulin. • Type 2 diabetes occurs when some insulin is made, but the body cannot use it well. Type 2 diabetes is more common. Diabetes is a serious disease. It happens when the body does not make enough insulin or cannot use it well. This causes high levels of glucose (blood sugar) to build up in the blood. As a result, the body does not work like it should. • The food we eat is digested in our stomach. Here it is turned into glucose, or blood sugar. • Blood takes glucose to our cells. • Glucose must enter into our cells so that we can have energy. Gluose needs the help of insulin to do this. • Glucose cannot\\n\\nenter into our cells if our body does not make enough insulin or if our cells cannot use the insulin well. This means the glucose will build up in the blood. • People who have high levels of glucose in their blood have prediabetes or diabetes. What Happens In Your Body? Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke. Over time, high blood glucose damages the body. Diabetes can lead to blindness, amputation, kidney problems, and death. Why Is Diabetes Dangerous? What Is Diabetes? Types of Diabetes\\n\\ndiabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes). • Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. • Have high blood pressure: - Your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher, or - A health care provider has told you that you have high blood pressure. • Have cholesterol levels that are not normal: - Your HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) is 40 mg/dL or lower, or - Your triglyceride level is 150 mg/dL or higher. • Do very little physical activity. For example, less than 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate activity and less than 2 days of strengthening activities per week. Are You At Risk For Developing Type 2 Diabetes? December 2013'"

            "Implementing AI in medical science involves various areas, including diagnostics, treatment recommendations, patient management, and operational efficiencies. Here are some key ways AI can be integrated:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Diagnostics**: AI can analyze medical images (like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) to identify conditions such as tumors and fractures more accurately than some human counterparts. For instance, machine learning algorithms are used in radiology to make faster diagnoses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Predictive Analytics**: AI systems can predict patient outcomes by analyzing data from electronic health records (EHRs). This can help in preemptively identifying high-risk patients and tailoring preventive care strategies, thus improving patient outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Treatment Personalization**: AI can help in creating personalized treatment plans by analyzing data about the patient's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and specific health issues, leading to more effective therapies, especially in fields like oncology.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Robotics**: AI-powered robotic systems assist in surgeries, providing greater precision and enhancing the outcomes of complex procedures.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Virtual Health Assistants**: These AI-powered tools can provide 24/7 assistance to patients, managing routine inquiries, medication reminders, or appointment scheduling, hence improving patient engagement.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Administrative Workflow**: AI can streamline operations within healthcare facilities by managing appointments, billing processes, and maintaining communications, thus reducing costs and increasing efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Research and Development**: AI models are being employed to analyze vast datasets for drug discovery, helping to accelerate the development of new medications and therapies.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Clinical Trials**: AI can identify suitable candidates for clinical trials, monitor patient adherence, and analyze data to provide insights faster and more effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Implementing such technologies requires careful consideration of regulatory compliance, patient privacy, and integration with existing clinical workflows. Each of these applications has the potential to transform how healthcare is delivered, making it more efficient and patient-centered. \n",
